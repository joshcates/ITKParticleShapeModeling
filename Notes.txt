*****To fix linker errors:*****
Try running ccmake and then make. If that doesn't work, delete the build directory for PSM from /ITK-4.4.1-build/Modules/External/ and rerun ccmake, and then make. For reader image type errors, add include_directories(${ITK_USE_FILE}) at the beginning of cmakelists.

Error for undefined symbol for PSMCommandLineClass::New() in PSMCommandLineTool fixed by including the .cxx file in PSMCommandLineTool.

XML Validation using Schema:
The optimization tag has to be ended with the closing tag on the same line as the last parameter. For some reason, an error is thrown if the closing tag is on a different line. The parameters can be on different lines. 

Prasanna's code-

itkParticleShapeMixedEffectsMatrixAttribute -> itkPSMMixedEffectsShapeMatrixAttribute

itkMaximumEntropyCorrespondenceSampler -> no need to move over. 

ShapeWorksRun -> 

Input data:
For the months example, the output of Intercept, intercept +0.5*slope, and so on wont make sense, you would need to look at intercept + number of months * slope.

For years as timepoints, it'll be intercept + number of years * slope. We can use the ComputeMean function in the PSMMixedEffectsShapeMatrixAttribute.h class. 

m_InterceptRand and m_SlopeRand:
so those are perturbations needed to get to each of the individuals
so if there are 10 individuals
there will be 10 m_interceptRand and m_Sloperand
so the group parameters plus the first of the rand parameters give us the estimated intercept and slope parameters for the 1st individual
when i say plus I mean
m_intercept + m_interceptRand1 + k * (m_slope + m_slopeRand)
